# U2DLicense

A restrictive license to use in commercial projects.

This repository contains the full license text of all versions. We strongly recommend using the newest version, as older ones may have loopholes and unspecified edge-cases.

Please note that this license can **never** be used in any open source projects, as it is simply not compatible.

# Licensing

Please add something along the lines of
```
<software name> is licensed under UDDL 1 or, at your discretion, any later version of the UDDL.
Please see LICENSE.md for the full text of the license.
```
into your main or client-included file.

If you don't want to bother upgrading the license constantly, use this:
```
<software name> is licensed under the newest version of the UDDL.
(c) <authors>, <year>
Please see github.com/MegapolisPlayer/U2DLicense for the full text of the license.
```
